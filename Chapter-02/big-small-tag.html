    <title>Big and Small Tags in HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The <big> tag is used to increase the font size of the text -->
    <big>Hello World!</big>
    <br> <!-- This adds a line break to separate the text -->

    <!-- The <small> tag is used to decrease the font size of the text -->
    <small>Hello World!</small>
</body>
</html>

<!--
Explanation:
The <big> tag makes the text larger than the surrounding text.
The <small> tag makes the text smaller than the surrounding text.
The <br> tag is used to insert a line break between the two text elements for better readability.

Note: The <big> and <small> tags are deprecated in HTML5, meaning they are no longer recommended for use. Instead, you might want to use CSS for styling text sizes. -->
