    <title>Br Tag in HTML</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- The <br> tag creates a line break here -->
    Hello, this is the first line.<br>

    <!-- Another line break after this line -->
    And this is the second line.<br>

    <!-- No <br> here, so this will be the last line without breaking -->
    Here's the third line!
</body>

</html>

<!-- 
Explanation of the Comments:
The first comment indicates where the first line breaks, thanks to the <br> tag.
The second comment similarly indicates where the second line breaks.
The final comment notes that there is no line break after the third line, meaning it will continue on the same line as any following text (if there were any).

This is a good demonstration of how to use the <br> tag for creating line breaks in HTML! -->
