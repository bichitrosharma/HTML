Explanation of Comments:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).
The <html lang="en"> tag indicates that the language of the document is English.
The <head> section contains meta information about the document, such as character set and viewport settings.
The <title> tag defines the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
The <body> section contains the content of the webpage. The comment clarifies that the paragraph includes a clickable link.
The target="_blank" attribute in the <a> tag (if added) would make the link open in a new tab. You can include it if you want users to stay on your page while accessing the link.

This structure is a good foundation for any HTML document! -->
