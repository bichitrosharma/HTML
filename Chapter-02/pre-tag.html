    <pre>
        Text in a pre element
        is displayed in a fixed-width
        font, and it preserves
        both      spaces and
        line breaks

<!-- 
Explanation of Comments:
The comment before the <pre> tag explains its purpose, which is to display text in a fixed-width font while preserving spaces and line breaks exactly as written in the HTML code.

Key Features of the <pre> Tag:
Fixed-Width Font: The text inside a <pre> tag is rendered in a monospaced (fixed-width) font, making it suitable for displaying code or other structured text.
Preservation of Formatting: Spaces and line breaks are preserved, so itâ€™s often used for displaying preformatted text, code snippets, or ASCII art.
    
This is a good example of how to use the <pre> tag effectively! -->
